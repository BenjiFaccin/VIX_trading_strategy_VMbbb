# Credits

This project has been an incredible journey of learning, building, testing, and automating â€” and it wouldnâ€™t have been possible without the help and support I received along the way.

## ðŸ’» Technical Support

Grateful to **ChatGPT**, my coding co-pilot throughout this entire journey.  
From cleaning thousands of files to structuring automation scripts and optimizing backtesting logic â€” I leaned on AI assistance to help speed up implementation, debug errors, and clarify design logic at every step.

Also, a special thanks to Estelle, supporting me everywhere, everytime and for everything. â€”
